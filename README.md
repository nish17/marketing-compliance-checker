# web-marketing-compliance-checker

## Overview
The Web marketing Compliance Checker is an API designed to assess web content against a specified compliance policy. It takes two URLs as input: one pointing to the compliance policy and another to the web page that needs to be checked. It then returns an assessment of the web content's compliance.

## Features
- **Web Scraping**: Dynamically scrapes content from any given URL.
- **Compliance Checking**: Checks scraped content against specified compliance policies.

There are 2 query params

1. url-to-check
2. compliance-policy

### Example cURL request

```sh

curl --location 'http://127.0.0.1:5000/process_urls?url-to-check=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.joinguava.com%2F&compliance-policy=https%3A%2F%2Fstripe.com%2Fdocs%2Ftreasury%2Fmarketing-treasury'

```

### Learnings

1. promptTemplate
    
    ```python
    prompt = PromptTemplate(
                input_variables=["product"],
                template="What is a good company name that makes {product}?",
            )
    
    prompt.format(product="Smart Apps using Large Language Models (LLMs)")
    ```
    easier, faster and cleaner way to reuse prompt and just change variables

2. Importance of Text splitting, creating embeddings

3. Benefits of semantic search which uses word embedding
    1. store in a vector database for efficient and faster retrieval
